## Cryptocat - browser-based webapp for encrypted chat
### http://crypto.cat
#### Beta software - code review highly appreciated.

Cryptocat lets you instantly set up secure conversations. It's an open source encrypted, private alternative to other services such as Facebook chat.

## Cool features
* A client-side 4096-bit Diffie-Hellman-Merkle public key agreement engine.
* A client-side AES-256 implementation is used to encrypt data.
* HMAC message integrity verification.
* The identity of chatters can be confirmed via key fingerprints, à la OTR.
* A seeded, cryptographically secure random number generator that relies on browser elements, DOM, JavaScript variable state, and more to produce entropy. The resulting entropy is hashed to produce the final seed, which is then fed back to the CSPRNG.
* Compatible with all modern browsers, and includes a mobile website that is fully compatible with iPhone, Android and BlackBerry.
* [Cryptocat Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij), a Chrome app that loads all code locally, and is secure from being served compromised code.
* Chats are securely deleted after 30 minutes of inactivity.
* A sleek design with time-stamping, optional audio notifications, fluid-window mode, and mobile support.

## Important notes
* Cryptocat provides strongly encrypted, secure communications. However, it is not a replacement to GPG. Think responsibly if you are in extreme, life-threatening situations.

* Paranoid users may want to use [Cryptocat Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij), a Chrome app that loads all code locally, and is secure from being served compromised code.

* The code for secure deletion of idle chats after 30 minutes is not included in the Cryptocat git repository. On the [production server](https://crypto.cat), it's actually a cron job that checks the modification time of chats and [wipe](http://linux.die.net/man/1/wipe)s them securely. Those wanting to set up similar functionality should consider writing something similar.

## About
Cryptocat is developed by [Nadim Kobeissi](http://nadim.cc). It uses parts of the [crypto-js](http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) library and the Bitcons iconset. Furthermore, Cryptocat is indebted to Paul Brodeur, David Mirza, Hasan Saleh, Morgan Sutherland and Tina Salameh for their suggestions and beta testing.
