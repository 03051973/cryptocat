## Cryptocat
### http://crypto.cat
# Beta software - code review highly appreciated.

# Cryptocat is a browser-based chatting webapp with encryption features.

## Cool features
* A client-side, multithreaded, OpenSSL cross-compatible RSA public key cryptography engine allows for instant 1048-bit encrypted chat.
* A client-side AES-256 implementation is used to encrypt data with the RSA keys.
* A seeded, cryptographically secure random number generator that relies on browser elements, DOM, JavaScript variable state, and more to produce entropy. The resulting entropy is hashed to produce the final seed, which is then fed back to the CSPRNG.
* The identity of chatters can be confirmed via key fingerprints, à la OTR.
* Cryptocat Verifier, a Google Chrome browser extension, can be used to verify the integrity of your Cryptocat session.
* Chats are securely deleted after 30 minutes of inactivity.
* A sleek, beautiful design with time-stamping, optional audio notifications, full screen mode, and more.

## Important notes
* Paranoid users may want to install [Cryptocat Verifier](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dlafegoljmjdfmhgoeojifolidmllaie), a Chrome extension that verifies that your Cryptocat session is not serving you modified JavaScript code.

* The code for secure deletion of idle chats after 30 minutes is not included in the Cryptocat git repository. On the production server at crypto.cat, it's actually a cron job that checks the modification time of chats and wipes them securely using [wipe](http://linux.die.net/man/1/wipe). People wanting to set up similar functionality on their server should consider writing a similar cron job.
