## Cryptocat Chrome - browser-based webapp for encrypted chat
### http://crypto.cat
#### Beta software - code review highly appreciated.

Cryptocat Chrome is a Chrome app version of Cryptocat that loads all code locally, and is thus secure from being served compromised code.

## Cool features
* A client-side 4096-bit Diffie-Hellman-Merkle public key agreement engine.
* A client-side AES-256 implementation is used to encrypt data.
* HMAC message integrity verification.
* The identity of chatters can be confirmed via key fingerprints, à la OTR.
* A seeded, cryptographically secure random number generator that relies on browser elements, DOM, JavaScript variable state, and more to produce entropy. The resulting entropy is hashed to produce the final seed, which is then fed back to the CSPRNG.
* Chats are securely deleted after one hour of inactivity.
* A sleek design with time-stamping, optional audio notifications, fluid-window mode, and mobile support.
* Translations available for French and Catalan.
